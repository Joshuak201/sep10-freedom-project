### Content
For this segment,the class has been learning the tool that they picked a month ago. Since then, I have beeen learing my tool by watching simple tutorials all the way to advanced utorials. I've been tinkering with code to make my own domains and have created a few so far. As I go on and on in this process, I am starting to learn more and more about a-frame and learning how to create things that would help with my project. So far, I've been trying to master the creation of 3D enviornments & elements from scratch. Like shown in my [learning log](learning-log.md), I have been tinkering with a-frame, creating 2 different mini projects to effectively learn my tool. 

### Reflection 
I am pretty happy that I decided to choose a-frame due to the ease and what you can do with it. So far, it has been a breeze for me to learn the code with me only encountering minor problems that can be easily fixed. Looking back, I've also been researching my tool instead of just running into pickcode and coding because I didn't want to rush the design process. 

### Sources
#### [A-frame](https://aframe.io/)
Using a-frame has been pretty easy and it even gives you documentations to help you further along your design processes.
#### [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/)
In this journey, youtube has been a bigg help, giving me tutorials, helping me understand a-frame, helping me to build enviornment & models with ease.
#### [Pickcode](https://pickcode.io)
Using pickcode has helped me tremendously, especially when tinkering and trying to learn new things.

### Engineering Design Process
For the past few weeks, I've been tinkering with code. Before the week of the break, I created a plan that I had to follow while I was in class and even out of class. That plan helped me to map out my coding goals and learning goals while utilizing A-frame. Here is the plan:
#### PLAN
#### Day 1:
* For the first day, I will continue my learning on how to build 3D environments by building a space environment with planets and potentially space-rockets
  * This will help me especially since my webpage will be centered around space.
* I also aim to finish coding 3D environments. If not, then it will have to cut into my second day.
#### Day 2:
* For this day I will watch videos and browse the web to find videos that will help me to finally start building one specific 3D element that will allow the user to interact with my made up tool that will aid in astrophysics.(Part B - Anti-Grav Device)
  * I will not start coding on this day.
    * I want to make sure that I FULLY understand it before rushing into coding.
      * I would need to focus on the utilization of shapes (cylinders, circles, primals, entities, boxes, triangles, and anything else that would bring my device to life) and the utilization of lighting on my 3D element.
#### Day 3:
* For the final day, I aim to fully understand and know how to code both interactable 3D environments and interactable 3D elements.

### Skills
Using these websites, following these plans, tinkering with code has helped me to expand on my skills with A-frane with me finally being able to create a 3D environment and start the coding of 3D models. The journey with A-frame so far has allowed me to explore new code lines and reveal the ease of using this HTML code line.

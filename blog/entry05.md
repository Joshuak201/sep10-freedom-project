### Content
For this segment,the class has been learning the tool that they picked a month ago. Since then, I have beeen learing my tool by watching simple tutorials all the way to advanced utorials. I've been tinkering with code to make my own domains and have created a few so far. As I go on and on in this process, I am starting to learn more and more about a-frame and learning how to create things that would help with my project. So far, I've been trying to master the creation of 3D enviornments & elements from scratch. Like shown in my [learning log](learning-log.md), I have been tinkering with a-frame, creating 2 different mini projects to effectively learn my tool. 

### Reflection 
I am pretty happy that I decided to choose a-frame due to the ease and what you can do with it. So far, it has been a breeze for me to learn the code with me only encountering minor problems that can be easily fixed. Looking back, I've also been researching my tool instead of just running into pickcode and coding because I didn't want to rush the design process.

#### [A-frame](aframe.io)
Using a-frame has been pretty easy and it even gives you documentations to help you further along your design processes.
#### [Youtube](youtube.com)
In this journey, youtube has been a bigg help, giving me tutorials, helping me understand a-frame, helping me to build enviornment & models with ease.
